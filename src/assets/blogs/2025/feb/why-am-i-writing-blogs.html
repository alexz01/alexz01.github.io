<p>Why am I writing blogs?</p>
<p>So why am I adding a blogs section to my website? I am not really a blogger to begin with, heck I don't even post on the social media sites.
Well basically I never learned to type; I mean know how to type just not how to type with your fingers on "asdf-jkl;."</p>
<p>My first interaction with computers was as my school when I was in 5th grade.
It was during the computer labs and as all other kids at that age all we did was play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Dave">Dangerous Dave</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyRoads_(video_game)">SkyRoads</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)">Prince Of Persia</a> on dos. We were being taught basics of programming using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>. I was a two finger then. Looking at keyboard and pressing keys to get that turtle moving.</p>
<p>Then when I was in 8th grade my mom bought us a Windows PC. People will still arguing about moving to windows XP. We got the machine with win98se and XP dual booted so we can make a choice and then get rid of the other. For us even with all the fear mongering and complaints of XP being slow we got rid of 98 as it was older and I just liked the GUI of XP. As before we got this with an excuse of using it for study, we mostlu used it for games. Halo and Carmageddon we our games at that time. So as any other gamer I just learned to use wasd and index finger on other hanbd with pinky on backspace. I actually got pretty good at typing this way but it was (is) still error prone (hence pinky on backspace).</p>
<p>So here I am now relearning to type and after using this website <a href="typingclub.com">typingclub.com</a> to relearn finger placement on a qwerty keyboard, I am going to write blogs like this one to practice my typing skills.</p>
<p>Btw it took me some 38 minutes to type this, so yeah I need more practiceâ€¦</p>
