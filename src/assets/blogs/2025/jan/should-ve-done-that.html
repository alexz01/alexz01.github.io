<h1 id="shouldvedonethat">Should've done that</h1>
<p>It has occurred to me that these days I see a lot of FOMO online. Or maybe it has always been like this and I am just now noticing it now.</p>
<p>I used to play a lot of Destiny 2, it was my THE game. But after spending some 2000 hours in it I noticed that this is just a big FOMO machine. It's always something new every week and if you don't do it or get it or some other verb you are going to miss your chance to get it. I used to play a lot of other video games, but soon this was the only game I was playing. It's not just the dailies/weeklies that I was chasing; the game itself was actually good. It is one of the best games with an almost unlimited range of weapons and armor. It is one of the best first person shooter ganes Ive played. And I was chasing it like crazy.</p>
<p>But then due to some personal reasons I wasn't able to play it for a while. And when I got back to it I just could't get back into it. It was as id the magic is gone. Then I realized it was that fomo of missing the stuff that kept me coming back. But now that I've missed so much it stopped mattering to chase the stuff as I'll always be behind. It's not like I can play the past season story to recoup it. So I guess it was a boon that the game is like this and because of the way it is I was able to get out of it.</p>
<p>Not sure where I was going with that but just one thing of note: games these days have this fomo to keep players hooked. Don't play games that list things like loot boxes, season pass or things that sound iterative/loopy in nature.</p>
